// variables in rod are very straightforward:
var myVariable = 2

// variables declared with 'var' can be mutated:
myVariable = 5

// one can declare variables with a default value:
var x: number // defaults to 0.0

// one other declaration type is available
// variables declared with 'let' cannot be re-assigned:
let Pi = 3.1415926
